        <h2>Biomolecules</h2>
        <p>Biomolecules have unique properties that determine how they contribute to the structure and function of cells and how they participate in the processes necessary to maintain life.</p>
        <p>The unique chemical and structural properties of biomolecules determine the roles they play in cells. The proper functioning of a living system depends on the many components acting harmoniously in response to a constantly changing environment. Biomolecules are constantly formed or degraded in response to the perceived needs of the organism.</p>

        <h2>Content Category 1A: Structure and function of proteins and their constituent amino acids</h2>
        <p>Focuses on:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The structural and functional complexity of proteins,</li>
            <li>which is derived from their component amino acids,</li>
            <li>the sequence in which the amino acids are covalently bonded,</li>
            <li>and the three-dimensional structures the proteins adopt in an aqueous environment.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <p>Macromolecules formed from amino acids adopt well-defined, three-dimensional structures with chemical properties that are responsible for their participation in virtually every process occurring within and between cells. The three-dimensional structure of proteins is a direct consequence of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the nature of the covalently bonded sequence of amino acids,</li>
            <li>their chemical and physical properties,</li>
            <li>and the way the whole assembly interacts with water.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Enzymes are proteins that interact in highly regio- and stereo-specific ways with dissolved solutes. They either facilitate the chemical transformation of these solutes or allow for their transport innocuously. Dissolved solutes compete for protein-binding sites, and protein conformational dynamics give rise to mechanisms capable of controlling enzymatic activity.</p>
        <p>The infinite variability of potential amino acid sequences allows for adaptable responses to pathogenic organisms and materials. The rigidity of some amino acid sequences makes them suitable for structural roles in complex living systems.</p>
        <p>Content in this category covers a range of protein behaviors that originate from the unique chemistry of amino acids themselves. Amino acid classifications and protein structural elements are covered. Special emphasis is placed on enzyme catalysis, including mechanistic considerations, kinetics, models of enzyme-substrate interaction, and regulation.</p>
